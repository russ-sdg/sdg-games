                              <p><em>Fruit of the Spirit</em> is a take-that and give-that game, meaning that the Deed cards often involve taking an action that hurts another player's chance of winning and the Fruit cards sometimes involve taking an action that blesses another player.</p>

                              <h4>Objective</h4>
                              <p>Be the first to display all 9 Fruit of the Spirit cards.</p>

                              <h4>Game Setup</h4>

                                <li>Remove the 2 game instruction cards from the deck.</li>

                              <p>Players take turns drawing, discarding, and playing Fruit and Deed cards.</p>
                              <p>On each turn, a player may:</p>
                              <p>Skip their turn, OR</p>
                              <ol>
                                <li>Draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile.</li>
                                <li>If possible, follow instructions on one Fruit Card or Deed Card.</li>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Some cards allow playing multiple cards in a single turn.</li>
                                  <li>When played, a Fruit Card is displayed face up in front of the player.</li>
                                  <li>A Deed Card can only be played on top of a displayed Fruit Card. That Fruit Card must be "re-earned", meaning that the player must get another of that Fruit in their hand again and follow the instructions again to be able to play it on top of the Deed Card.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Discard a card.</li>
                              </ol>
                              <p>At the end of each turn, the player draws or discards cards as necessary to end the turn with 5 cards in his hand.</p>

                              <p>The <em>Fruit of the Spirit</em> deck is comprised of 90 cards:

                                    <li>8 of each of the 9 Fruit cards (72 total)</li>

                                    <li>2 cards explaining the game rules (2 total)</li>
                                </ul>

                              <p>The 2 cards explaining the game rules are removed from the deck before playing the game. Each of the remaining 88 cards includes text explaining what happens when the card gets played. Let's look at each of the cards individually to better understand these actions.</p>

                              <h4>Fruit Cards</h4>
                              <p>Each of the Fruit cards has the name of the fruit at the top, an icon for that fruit in the top left, instructions for playing the card in the center, and at the bottom the word "Fruit" and an icon of an olive tree indicating that this is a Fruit card.</p>
                              <div style="padding: 10px">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-fluid" src="../assets/FS Love Banner.png" alt="Love">
                              </div>
                              <p>To play the Love card, a player must discard any Deed card without playing it.</p>
                              <p>Jesus said "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.” (John 13:34-35 WEB)<p>
                              <p>Christ loves the church unconditionally, sacrificially, and with a purpose. By refusing to hurt your fellow players with a Deed card, you are demonstrating your love for them.</p>
                              <p>This counts as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn, although it can also be played in the same turn as a Faithfulness card, and a Joy card can be played immediately following the Love card.</p>
                              <p>The discarding of the Deed card counts as the one discard that is part of the turn.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Love card is a heart-shaped tree formed by a collection of hearts of different sizes and shades. The heart is the universal symbol for love.</p>

                              <div style="padding: 10px">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-fluid" src="../assets/FS Joy Banner.png" alt="Joy">
                              </div>
                              <p>You may play the Joy card immediately after playing another Fruit card.</p>
                              <p>Paul wrote "Rejoice in the Lord always! Again I will say, 'Rejoice!'" (Philippians 4:4 WEB)</p>
                              <p>Growing in fruitfulness is certainly worthy of rejoicing!</p>
                              <p>This does not count as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Joy card is of a woman rejoicing, surrounded by oranges. Orange is a color often associated with joy.</p>

                              <div style="padding: 10px">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-fluid" src="../assets/FS Peace Banner.png" alt="Peace">
                              </div>
                              <p>In order to play the Peace card, invite all players (including yourself) to discard a card from their hand and draw a replacement card. Each player can decide whether or not to accept the invitation.</p>
                              <p>Jesus said "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God." (Matthew 5:9 WEB)</p>
                              <p>In some ways, Peace is the opposite of Strife. While the Strife card can cause great distress over an uncontrolled loss, the Peace card represents an opportunity for all players to make their own decision with potential for gain.</p>
                              <p>This counts as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn, although it can also be played in the same turn as a Faithfulness card, and a Joy card can be played immediately following the Peace card.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Peace card is of a dove carrying a fruit branch. The dove is often used as a symbol for peace.</p>

                              <div style="padding: 10px">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-fluid" src="../assets/FS Patience Banner.png" alt="Patience">
                              </div>
                              <p>In order to play the Patience card, you must skip a turn without drawing, discarding, or playing a Fruit or Deed card. On the following turn, you may play the Patience card as the one Fruit card you play.</p>
                              <p>Paul wrote "But if we hope for that which we don’t see, we wait for it with patience." (Romans 8:25 WEB)</p>
                              <p>Good things are worth waiting for, including earning the Patience card.</p>
                              <p>This counts as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn, although it can also be played in the same turn as a Faithfulness card, and a Joy card can be played immediately following the Patience card.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Patience card is of an Aloe Vera plant. This plant can survive months waiting for rain, and the word "Aloe" simply means patience. The Aloe Vera plant is also known for its healing properties, just as patience can heal many damaged relationships and wounds.</p>

                              <div style="padding: 10px">

                              </div>
                              <p>In order to play the Kindness card, you must first take a card from your hand and play it for an opponent. It must be a card that is not currently displayed in front of them. You place the card in front of them as if they had successfully played it. You then play the Kindness card in front of yourself.</p>
                              <p>Jesus said "But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil." (Luke 6:35 WEB)</p>
                              <p>Helping an opponent towards their own goal is certainly a way of showing love and kindness to them.</p>
                              <p>This counts as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn, although obviously you will also play another Fruit card for another player; it can also be played in the same turn as a Faithfulness card; and a Joy card can be played immediately following the Kindness card.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Kindness card is of a fruit being carried forth on angels' wings.</p>

                              <p>To play the Goodness card, recite from memory the nine Fruits of the Spirit. They don't have to be in order and they don't have to be from any specific Bible translation (e.g. saying "longsuffering" rather than "patience" is perfectly acceptable).</p>
                              <p>Paul wrote "Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report: if there is any virtue and if there is any praise, think about these things" (Philippians 4:8 WEB)</p>
                              <p>The Fruit of the Spirit represents Christlikeness, which is certainly also goodness.</p>
                              <p>This counts as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn, although it can also be played in the same turn as a Faithfulness card, and a Joy card can be played immediately following the Goodness card.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Goodness card is of a plum. The plum tree blossoms appear at the end of winter from seemingly dead branches and is seen as a symbol of the life of Spring overcoming the deadness of Winter, or more generally of good overcoming evil.</p>

                              <p>Whenever you draw the Faithfulness card from either the draw or discard pile, you immediately either play it or discard it, draw another card, and continue play. You cannot play the Faithfulness card if it is dealt to you or given to you.</p>
                              <p>Paul wrote "God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord." (1 Corinthians 1:9 WEB)</p>
                              <p>We are called to be faithful, just as God is faithful. He who began a good work in you is faithful and will complete it.</p>
                              <p>This does not count as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Faithfulness card is of a "fruitful" anchor representing the sure and steadfast hope we have in Christ.</p>

                              <p>To play the Gentleness card, give one of the cards in your hand to the player with the fewest cards played in front of them. The card you give must be one that they have not yet played and it goes into their hand so that they can play it in the future.</p>
                              <p>Paul wrote "Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren’t tempted. Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ." (Galatians 6:1-2 WEB)</p>
                              <p>Gentleness implies emphathy and compassion. We recognize in others shortcomings that we also have or had in the past, and we earnestly desire that they overcome those weaknesses.</p>
                              <p>This counts as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn, although it can also be played in the same turn as a Faithfulness card, and a Joy card can be played immediately following the Gentleness card.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Gentleness card is of sweetgrass, a traditional symbol of gentleness, kindness, and compassion.</p>

                                <img class="img-responsive img-fluid" src="../assets/FS Self Control Banner.png" alt="Self Control">
                              </div>
                              <p>You may play the Self-Control card at any time to block any player (including yourself) from using an Deed card. The Deed card is still played on top of one of the Deed-playing player's Fruit cards.</p>
                              <p>Paul wrote "For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control." (2 Timothy 1:7 WEB)</p>
                              <p>Sometimes we exercise self-control on our own with the Holy Spirit's help. Other times, our brothers and sisters help us to keep from doing evil deeds.</p>
                              <p>This does not count as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Self Control card is of a cluster of grapes. Self control has often been closely associated with temperance movements. Drunkeness is a form of lack of self control in itself and also leads to loss of self control in other areas of life.</p>

                              <h4>Deed Cards</h4>
                              <p>Each Deed card has the name of the deed at the top, instructions for playing the card in the center, and the word "Deed" and icons of a snake in a garden in the top left and bottom right corners indicating this is a Deed of the Flesh card.</p>
                              <p>The icon of a snake in the grass represents Satan, the father of all evil deeds.</p>
                              <p>Paul wrote "But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ." (2 Corinthians 11:3)</p>

                              <p>When you play the Envy card, you take a card that another player has played in front of them and place it in your hand.</p>
                              <p>Paul wrote "But godliness with contentment is great gain." (1 Timothy 6:6 WEB)</p>
                              <p>Envy is a feeling of discontentment and resentment along with a desire for something another has.</p>
                              <p>This counts as the one Deed or Fruit card that can be played during a turn, although it can also be played in the same turn as a Faithfulness card.</p>

                              <p>When you play the Jealousy card, you draw an extra card from the draw pile.</p>
                              <p>James warned "For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed." (James 3:16 WEB)</p>
                              <p>Jealousy reflects a lack of contentment with what God has provided and a hunger for more.</p>

                              <p>When you play the Rivalry card, you ask another player to hold their cards up for you to blindly take one from them. You pick a card from your hand to give them in return.</p>
                              <p>Paul wrote "doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;" (Philippians 2:3 WEB)</p>
                              <p>An unhealthy desire to win at all costs causes us to act in a selfish and unloving way.</p>
                              <p>This counts as the one Deed or Fruit card that can be played during a turn, although it can also be played in the same turn as a Faithfulness card.</p>

                              <p>When you play the Strife card, you ask another player to hold their cards up for you to blindly take one from them. You immediately discard that card.</p>
                              <p>We read in Proverbs that "A perverse man stirs up strife." (Proverbs 16:28 WEB)</p>
                              <p>Stirring up strife is senseless, selfish, and destructive.</p>
