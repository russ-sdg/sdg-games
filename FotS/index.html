                              <p><em>Fruit of the Spirit</em> is a take-that and give-that card game.</p>

                              <p>The goal of the game is to collect and present all nine fruits listed in Galatians 5:22-23.</p>
                              <p class='text-center'><em>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.</em> (Galatians 5:22-23 ESV)</p>

                              <p>The <em>Fruit of the Spirit</em> deck is comprised of 90 cards:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>8 of each of the 9 Fruit Cards (72 total)</li>

                              </div>

                              <p>The 2 cards explaining the game rules are removed from the deck before playing the game. Each of the remaining 88 cards includes text explaining what happens when the card gets played. Let's look at each of the cards individually to better understand these actions.</p>

                              <h4>Fruit Cards</h4>
                              <div style="padding: 10px">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-fluid" src="../assets/FS Love Banner.png" alt="Love">
                              </div>
                              <p>To play the Love card, a player must discard any Deed card without playing it.</p>
                              <p>Jesus said "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.” (John 13:34-35 WEB)<p>
                              <p>Christ loves the church unconditionally, sacrificially, and with a purpose. By refusing to hurt your fellow players with a Deed card, you are demonstrating your love for them.</p>
                              <p>This counts as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn, although it can also be played in the same turn as a Faithfulness card and a Joy card can be played immediately following the Love card.</p>
                              <p>The discarding of the Deed card counts as the one discard that is part of the turn.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Love card is a heart shaped tree formed by a collection of hearts of different sizes and shades. The heart is the universal symbol for love.</p>

                              <div style="padding: 10px">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-fluid" src="../assets/FS Joy Banner.png" alt="Joy">
                              </div>
                              <p>You may play the Joy card immediately after playing another Fruit card.</p>
                              <p>Paul wrote "Rejoice in the Lord always! Again I will say, 'Rejoice!'" (Philippians 4:4 WEB)</p>
                              <p>Growing in fruitfulness is certainly worthy of rejoicing!</p>
                              <p>This does not count as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Joy card is of a woman rejoicing, surrounded by oranges. Orange is a color often associated with joy.</p>

                              <div style="padding: 10px">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-fluid" src="../assets/FS Peace Banner.png" alt="Peace">
                              </div>
                              <p>In order to play the Peace card, invite all players (including yourself) to discard a card from their hand and draw a replacement card. Each player can decide whether or not to accept the invitation.</p>
                              <p>Jesus said "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God." (Matthew 5:9 WEB)</p>
                              <p>In some ways, Peace is the opposite of Strife. While the Strife card can cause great distress over an uncontrolled loss, the Peace card represents an opportunity for all players to make their own decision with potential for gain.</p>
                              <p>This counts as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn, although it can also be played in the same turn as a Faithfulness card and a Joy card can be played immediately following the Peace card.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Peace card is of a dove carrying a fruit branch. The dove is often used as a symbol for peace.</p>

                              <div style="padding: 10px">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-fluid" src="../assets/FS Patience Banner.png" alt="Patience">
                              </div>
                              <p>In order to play the Patience card, you must skip a turn without drawing, discarding, or playing a Fruit or Deed card. On the following turn, you may play the Patience card as the one Fruit card you play.</p>
                              <p>Paul wrote "But if we hope for that which we don’t see, we wait for it with patience." (Romans 8:25 WEB)</p>
                              <p>Good things are worth waiting for, including earning the Patience card.</p>
                              <p>This counts as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn, although it can also be played in the same turn as a Faithfulness card and a Joy card can be played immediately following the Patience card.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Patience card is of an Aloe Vera plant. This plant can survive months waiting for rain and the word "Aloe" simply means patience. The Aloe Vera plant is also known for its healing properties, just as patience can heal many damaged relationships and wounds.</p>

                              <div style="padding: 10px">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-fluid" src="../assets/FS Kindness Banner.png" alt="Kindness">
                              </div>
                              <p>In order to play the Kindness card, you must first take a card from your hand and play it for an opponent. It must be a card they have not yet earned (or has been taken or covered by a Deed card). You place the card in front of them as if they had successfully played it. You then play the Kindness card in front of yourself.</p>
                              <p>Jesus said "But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil." (Luke 6:35 WEB)</p>
                              <p>Helping an opponent towards their own goal is certainly a way of showing love and kindness to them.</p>
                              <p>This counts as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn, although obviously you will also play another Fruit card for another player; it can also be played in the same turn as a Faithfulness card; and a Joy card can be played immediately following the Kindness card.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Kindness card is of a fruit being carried forth on angels' wings.</p>

                              <div style="padding: 10px">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-fluid" src="../assets/FS Goodness Banner.png" alt="Goodness">
                              </div>
                              <p>To play the Goodness card, recite from memory the nine Fruits of the Spirit. They don't have to be in order and they don't have to be from any specific Bible translation (e.g. saying "longsuffering" rather than "patience" is perfectly acceptable).</p>
                              <p>Paul wrote "Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report: if there is any virtue and if there is any praise, think about these things" (Philippians 4:8 WEB)</p>
                              <p>The Fruit of the Spirit represents Christlikeness, which is certainly also goodness.</p>
                              <p>This counts as the one Fruit or Deed card that can be played during a turn, although it can also be played in the same turn as a Faithfulness card and a Joy card can be played immediately following the Goodness card.</p>
                              <p>The icon on the Goodness card is of a plum. The plum tree blossoms appear at the end of winter from seemingly dead branches and is seen as a symbol of the life of Spring overcoming the deadness of Winter, or more generally of good overcoming evil.</p>

                              <p><em>Fruit of the Spirit</em> is a take-that and give-that game, meaning that the Deed cards often involve taking an action that hurts another player's chance of winning and the Fruit cards sometimes involve taking an action that blesses another player.</p>

                              <h4>Objective</h4>
                              <p>Be the first to display all 9 Fruit of the Spirit Cards.</p>

                                <li>Turn the top card over to form a discard pile.</li>
                              </ol>

                              <h4>Game Play</h4>
                              <p>Players take turns drawing, discarding, and playing Fruit and Deed Cards.</p>
                              <p>On each turn, a player may:</p>
                              <p>Skip their turn, OR</p>
                              <ol>
                                <li>Draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile.</li>
                                <li>If possible, follow instructions on one Fruit Card or Deed Card.</li>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Some cards allow playing multiple cards in a single turn.</li>
                                  <li>When played, a Fruit Card is displayed place up in front of the player.</li>
                                  <li>A Deed Card can only be played on top of a displayed Fruit Card. That Fruit Card must be "re-earned", meaning that the player must get another of that Fruit in their hand again and follow the instructions again to be able to play it on top of the Deed Card.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Discard a card.</li>
                              </ol>
                              <p>At the end of each turn, the player draws or discards cards as necessary to end the turn with 5 cards in his hand.</p>

                              <h4>Illuminate Game Bidding, Scoring, and Playing Variations:</h4>

                              <ul>
                                <li>Not Perfect bidding: The sum of all player bids can’t match the number of cards in the hand. Since the dealer bids last, this constrains how he can bid. (This can be especially helpful in a 2 person game.)</li>
                                <li>Shorter Game: Instead of playing 12 hands, only play 6 hands. You can either play hands of 1,2,3,4,5, and 6 cards, or hands of 2,4,6,8,10, and 12 cards.</li>
                                <li>Longer Game: Instead of playing 12 hands, play 23 hands. Play hands of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2, and 1 cards. The special scoring rules apply to both hands of 6 and the hand of 12.</li>
                              </ul>

                              <h4>Other Games to Play with the Illuminate Deck:</h4>
