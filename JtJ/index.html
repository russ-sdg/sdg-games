                              <h4>Game Setup</h4>
                              <p>To prepare to play the game:</p>
                              <ol>
                                <li><strong>Each Player Receives:</strong></li>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>One Map Map</li>
                                  <li>One Dry Erase Marker</li>
                                  <li>One Colored Player Token</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li><strong>Shuffle the 18 character cards</strong> and place them face-down in a draw pile within reach of all players.</li>
                                <li><strong>Each player draws 2 character cards,</strong> secretly looks at them, chooses 1 to keep, and returns the other face-down to the bottom of the deck. Keep your chosen card secret from other players.</li>
                                <li><strong>Each player places their token</strong> on any square on their map mat that matches their token color. This is your starting position.<br /><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Start as close as possible to one end of your character's journey.</em></li>
                              </ol>
                              <h4>How to Play</h4>
                              <p><strong>Players take turns rolling the die.</strong> The youngest player goes first, with play passing to the player's left.</p>
                              <p><strong>When a player rolls, all players act:</strong>
                              <ol>
                                <li><strong>Everyone moves:</strong> All players simultaneously move their tokens <strong>up to</strong> the number shown on the die along the colored paths on their individual map mats. You may move fewer space if you wish in order to finish on a key site, but you cannot move more spaces than the die shows.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mark visited spaces:</strong> If you finish your move on one of the 11 key Biblical sites (shown with an icon and a site name label), circle that site in the tracking area of your mat.</li>
                                <li><strong>Complete a journey:</strong> If any player has collected all the required site visits shown on their character card, they may immediately announce completion, even if it's not their turn to roll.</li>
                              </ol></p>
                              <div class="text-center" style="padding: 10px">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-fluid" src="../assets/JtJgameplay.webp">
                              </div>
                              <p><strong>When you complete a character journey:</strong></p>
                              <ul>
                                <li><strong>Reveal:</strong> Announce which character you're completing. Place your character card face-up in front of you.</li>
                                <li><strong>Clear:</strong> Erase all the markings from the tracking area of your mat so that you start fresh with your next character.</li>
                                <li><strong>Choose:</strong> Draw two new character cards (if available). Choose one to play and return the other to the bottom of the deck.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <h4>Ending the Game</h4>
                              <p>The game ends immediately when any player completes at least one journey from each of the three categories: One Apostle, One Friend of Jesus, and One Enemy of Christ.</p>
                              <p>Players tally their scores, adding the points on the journeys they completed, plus 5 points for each location they visited in their current incomplete journey (if any).</p>
                              <p>The winner is the player with the most points. If there is a tie, the player with the most completed journeys wins.</p>
                              <h4>Strategy Tips</h4>
                              <p><strong>Choose your starting position wisely:</strong> Start on a colored square as close as possible to a site that appears on your first character card.</p>
                              <p><strong>Choose your characters wisely:</strong> For your second and subsequent characters, consider which categories of characters you have yet to complete, but also consider how close your token is to sites required for the characters you are choosing between.</p>
                              <p><strong>Watch your opponents:</strong> Pay attention to which categories they have already completed and which sites they are visiting. If they appear close to completing their third category, you might focus on maximizing points you can quickly collect rather than trying to complete all three categories yourself.</p>
                              <p><strong>Balance risk and reward:</strong> Higher-point journeys typically require more sites but offer greater rewards. Consider whether speed or points matter more based on the current state of the game.</p>
                              <p><strong>Points vs. speed:</strong> There's tension between ending the game (by completing all three categories) and maximizing points (by completing more journeys). A player who completes five shorter journeys may score more than the player who completes three categories first.</p>
                              <h4>Optional Rules and Variants</h4>
                              <p><strong>Longer Game:</strong> For a longer game, consider one of two approaches:
                              <ol>
                                <li>Only the player who rolls the die moves on his turn.</li>
                                <li>Play until all character cards have been drawn and one player has completed their journey.</li>
                              </ol></p>
                              <p><strong>Team Play:</strong> Play in teams of two, combining your completed journeys and points. The game ends when one team has collectively completed at least two journeys from each category.</p>
                              <p><strong>Scripture Reading Mode:</strong> When any player lands on a key site for the first time in the game, that player reads the Bible verses associated with that location on their character card.</p>

                            </div>
                            <div class="card-body">
                              <h5>If I complete one journey from each category, do I automatically win?</h5>
                              <p>Not necessarily. Completing all three categories ends the game, but the player with the most total points wins.</p>
                              <h5>Can I complete a character journey on someone else's turn?</h5>
                              <p>Yes! As soon as you have all the required site visits, you may announce completion immediately, even if it's not your turn.</p>
                              <h5>What happens if we run out of character cards in the deck?</h5>
                              <p>If a player completes a journey and there are no character cards remaining to draw, then the game ends immediately.</p>
                              <h5>What if neither of the cards I draw after completing a journey are in a category that I need to finish my set of all three categories?</h5>
                              <p>You must always choose one of the two cards you draw to play, even if it's not required for reaching the end-game state. All completed journeys score points and may contribute to winning.</p>
                              <h5>Do I need to visit the sites in the order listed on the character card?</h5>
                              <p>No. You may visit the sites in any order. As soon as you have visited all the sites listed on the card you have completed that journey.</p>
                              <h5>Do I need to complete the character cards in a specific order?</h5>
                              <p>No. You can complete them in any order. If you complete one from each category, then the game ends.</p>

                              <p><strong>Journeys through Jerusalem</strong> has been designed by SDG Games to teach and commemorate the events surrounding Jesus' death and resurrection through engaging gameplay that combines strategy, Biblical knowledge, and meaningful storytelling. Each character's journey reflects actual sites they likely visited based on the Gospel accounts.</p>
                              <p>The three categories of characters represent different perspectives on Jesus' final days: those who followed Him faithfully, those who showed Him compassion, and those who opposed Him. By requiring players to complete journeys from all three perspectives, the game encourages players to reflect on the gospel message that Christ can redeem even His fiercest enemies.</p>
