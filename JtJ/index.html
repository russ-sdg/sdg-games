                              <p>To prepare to play the game:</p>
                              <ol>
                                <li><strong></strong>Each Player Receives:</strong></li>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>One Map Map</li>
                                  <li>One Dry Erase Marker</li>
                                  <li>One Colored Player Token</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li><strong>Shuffle the 18 character cards</strong> and place them face-down in a draw pile within reach of all players.</li>
                                <li><strong>Each player draws 2 character cards,</strong> secretly looks at them, chooses 1 to keep, and returns the other face-down to the bottom of the deck. Keep your chosen card secret from other players.</li>
                                <li><strong>Each player places their token</strong> on any square on their map mat that matches their token color. This is your starting position.<br /><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Start as close as possible to one end of your character's journey.</em></li>
                              </ol>
                              <h4>How to Play</h4>
                              <p><strong>Players take turns rolling the die.</strong> The youngest player goes first, with play passing to the player's left.</p>
                              <p><strong>When a player rolls, all players act.</strong></p>
                              <ol>
                                <li><strong>Everyone moves:</strong> All players simultaneously move their tokens <strong>up to</strong> the number shown on the die along the colored paths on their individual map mats. You may move fewer space if you wish in order to finish on a key site, but you cannot move more spaces than the die shows.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mark visited spaces:</strong> If you finish your move on one of the 11 key Biblical sites (shown with an icon and a site name label), circle that site in the tracking area of your mat.</li>
                                <li><strong>Complete a journey:</strong> If any player has collected all the required site visits shown on their character card, they may immediately announce completion, even if it's not their turn to roll.</li>
                              </ol>
                              <div class="text-center" style="padding: 10px">

                              <p><strong>When you complete a character journey:</strong></p>

                                <li><strong>Reveal:</strong> Announce which character you're completing. Place your character card face-up in front of you.</li>
                                <li><strong>Clear:</strong> Erase all the markings from the tracking area of your mat so that you start fresh with your next character.</li>
                                <li><strong>Choose:</strong> Draw two new character cards (if available). Choose one to play and return the other to the bottom of the deck.</li>

                              <h4>Ending the Game</h4>
                              <p>The game ends immediately when any player completes at least one journey from each of the three categories: One Apostle, One Friend of Jesus, and One Enemy of Christ.</p>
                              <p>Players tally their scores, adding the points on the journeys they completed, plus 5 points for each location they visited in their current incomplete journey (if any).</p>
                              <p>The winner is the player with the most points. If there is a tie, the player with the most completed journeys wins.</p>
                              <h4>Game Play</h4>
                              <p>Players take turns. On your turn, you:
                                <ul>
                                  <li>May recite from memory a scripture from any one <strong>Place Card</strong> in your hand. If successful, receive a <strong>Scripture Memory Token</strong>.</li>
                                  <li>Draw three additional <strong>Place Cards</strong> from the top of any mix of the draw piles, including the face-down draw pile.</strong></li>
                                  <li>As necessary, immediately turn over cards from the face-down draw pile to fill any gaps in the face-up piles.</li>
                                  <li>Present any completed in-play journeys and if possible extend those journeys to complete additional in-play journeys.</li>
                                  <li>Immediately replace any completed <strong>Journey Cards</strong> with new in-play journeys from the draw pile. If possible you may complete these newly in-play journeys.</li>
                                  <li>Remove from the game the <strong>Place Cards</strong> played for a journey.</li>
                                  <li>Place the completed <strong>Journey Card(s)</strong> face-up in front of you to reflect the score you earned.</li>
                                  <li>If you have fewer than 7 <strong>Place Cards</strong> in your hand, draw from the top of any pile as needed until you have 7 <strong>Place Cards</strong>. </li>
                                  <li>Your turn is over.</li>
                                </ul>

                              <h4>Ending the Game</h4>
                              <p>The game ends when the last <strong>Journey Card</strong> is completed. If necessary, shuffle the played <strong>Place Cards</strong> and return them to the face-down draw pile.</p>
                              <p>You win if you have the most total points earned from completed journeys and from earned but unplayed <strong>Scripture Memory Tokens</strong>, which are worth 5 points each.</p>

                              <h5>How does the new edition of <em>Journeys with Jesus</em> differ from the original (Legacy) version?</h5>
                              <p>The primary goal with the new edition was to bring the price down. To accomplish that we have reduced the number of cards included in the game, reduced the overall size of the <strong>Gameboard</strong>, eliminated the tuck box for the cards, and used a smaller game box. Specifically, we have eliminated the journeys that only appear in the Gospel of John and included only the journeys that appear in the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke). This allowed us to reduce the number of <strong>Place Cards</strong> from 85 to 59, the number of <strong>Journey Cards</strong> from 23 to 13, and the number of <strong>Scripture Memory Tokens</strong> from 24 to 12. The <strong>Gameboard</strong> has gone from 18" x 18" down to 8" x 16" (the main map portion of the board has only been reduced slightly). The box has shrunk from 12" x 9.5" x 2" to 8.5" x 5" x 1.5". Because of the reduced card decks, the recommended maximum number of players has been reduced from 5 to 4 and the estimated game length has been reduced from 30-60 minutes to 15-30 minutes.</p>
                              <h5>Are the eliminated cards still available?</h5>
                              <p>All of the eliminated <strong>Journey Cards</strong> and <strong>Place Cards</strong> are available as a <em>Gospel of John Expansion Pack</em> which can be ordered from <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/jwj-gospel-of-john-expansion">The Game Crafter</a>.</p>
                              <h5>From which Bible translation are the scriptures on the cards taken?</h5>
                              <p>All scriptures are taken from the <em>World English Bible</em>, which is in the public domain.</p>
                              <h5>Who did the artwork on the box?</h5>
                              <p>That artwork was created using the AI tool MidJourney.</p>
                              <h5>Where did the satellite imagery come from for the <strong>Gameboard</strong> and <strong>Journey Cards</strong>?</h5>
                              <p>Satellite images are from NASA's Visible Earth project.</p>
                              <h5>There's a spot on the <strong>Gameboard</strong> labelled Countryside. What is that?</h5>
                              <p>John 3:22 references an unnamed place in Judea. We have called this place “Countryside” and placed it on the <strong>Gameboard</strong> generally between Jerusalem and Sychar.</p>
                              <h5>Why does Gennesaret appear on the <strong>Gameboard</strong> on the east side of the Sea of Galilee?</h5>
                              <p>Gennesaret is believed to have been on the northwest coast of the Sea of Galilee, between Capernaum and Magdala. That portion of the map is already pretty crowded. Gennesaret is referenced in Matthew and Mark as being reached by boat, so we depict it in the game as being on the large lake, but not in precisely the right location.</p>
                              <h5>Mount Hermon isn't mentioned in the New Testament. Why is it a journey destination?</h5>
                              <p>Many scholars surmise that Mt. Herman may be where Jesus’ transfiguration took place. We don't know for sure, but we wanted to include the journeys to and from the transfiguration in the game, so we chose to use Mount Hermon to represent that destination.</p>
                              <h5>What resources did you use to identify Biblical locations?</h5>
                              <p>Our most useful reference tool was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crossway-Bible-Atlas-John-Currid/dp/1433501929/">The ESV Bible Atlas</a>, but other books we referenced include <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Land-Bible-Biblical-Theological-Guide/dp/0875523994/">Understanding the Land of the Bible</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wycliffe-Historical-Geography-Bible-Lands/dp/0802496997/">Wycliffe Historical Geography of Bible Lands</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whos-Who-Wheres-Where-Bible/dp/1593101112/">Who's Who and Where's Where in the Bible</a>. The online <a href="https://bibleatlas.org/">Bible Atlas</a> also proved helpful. Not all of these resources agree with each other. We did our best to accurately represent the location of different places and believe we have placed them in generally the right area, but perhaps not the precise longitude and lattitude.</p>

                                <li>We read often in the gospels about Jesus’ compassion. Similarly show compassion and grace to those in your game. For example, for young players, simply reading the scripture may be enough of an accomplishment to earn a <strong>Scripture Memory Token</strong>.</li>
                                <li>When first learning to play, or in settings where everyone is focused on learning and having fun more than winning, players can place all of their <strong>Place Cards</strong> face up in front of them and players can help each other find completed journeys.</li>
                                <li>A <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/jwj-gospel-of-john-expansion">Gospel of John Expansion
                                  Pack</a> is available for purchase which adds 10 additional <strong>Journey Cards</strong> and 26 additional <strong>Place Cards</strong>. These cards are simply added to the cards already in the game. All the other rules still apply.</li>
