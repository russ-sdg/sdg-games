                              <p><em>Tyndale</em> is a hidden movement game. One player is on the run, trying to complete translation, printing, and shipping of the Bible while the other players try to track him down based on clues Tyndale leaves behind.</p>
                              <p>William Tyndale has fled England to Europe with the mission of translating the Bible from the original Hebrew and Greek into English. The Bishop of London is determined to stop him. Tyndale will need to move around Europe to avoid capture. As he completes translation of portions of scripture, he must visit a new Printing Centre to get each one printed, and then get the printed copies to a Coastal City for shipment to England.</p>
                              <p>At the beginning of the game, Tyndale has completed translation of the New Testament. He needs to get it to a Printing Centre to get it published and then to a Coastal City, so that he can ship it and begin working on translating the Pentatuch. At each city that he visits, he will “leave behind” copies of his most recently published translation (if any). These will be clues for those chasing or helping him. Once a published translation reaches a Coastal City, it independently (in the hands of trusted merchants) begins the journey across the English Channel or North Sea and then the English countryside towards London.</p>
                              <p>The game may be played by two to six players and typically takes 30 to 90 minutes to play.</p>

                              <div class="text-center" style="padding: 10px; max-width: 100%">
                                <img src="../assets/TyndaleBoard.png" width="100%">

                              <ul>
                                <li>The gameboard represents a map of England and Europe.</li>
                                <li>The map is overlaid with a grid.</li>
                                <li>The vertical grid lines are labeled A-K and the horizontal gird lines are labeled 1-11.</li>
                                <li>On land, the intersections of the grid lines are cities and towns. On water, the intersecting locations are also legal moves (by boat), but aren't labeled.</li>
                                <li>Printing Centres are cities marked by a large circle and labeled with the city name.</li>
                                <li>Coastal Cities are cities or towns that are one step away from a water location.</li>
                                <li>Cities and towns loyal to the Pope are colored Red.</li>
                                <li>Cities and towns sympathetic to the Reformation are colored Blue.</li>
                              </ul>

                              <h4>Pawns</h4>

                                <li>There will be 4 or 5 pawns moving from location to location on the Gameboard.</li>
                                <li>These pawns represent the Bishop’s Agents who are searching for Tyndale. (Although one might be a Secret Supporter who is actually helping him.)</li>
                                <li>Pawns move vertically and horizontally along the grid lines on the Gameboard.</li>
                              </ul>

                              <p>The game uses a 6 sided die with values 1, 2, and 3.</p>
                              <h4>Scorecard</h4>
                              <ul>

                                <li>Each Scorecard shows a simplified representation of the Gameboard.</li>
                                <li>Tyndale uses his Scorecard to record where he has left copies of his Publications.</li>
                                <li>Bishop’s Agents use their Scorecards to record clues they find as they search for Tyndale.</li>
                                <li>The small numbers next to Coastal Cities indicate their distance from London.</li>
                              </ul>

                              <p>There are four types of cards used in the game.</p>
                              <h5>Tyndale Card</h5>
                              <p>The player playing as William Tyndale gets this card.</p>

                              <h5>Bishop's Agents Cards</h5>
                              <p>If there are 5 or 6 players, each of the Bishop's Agent players will blindly draw a card to find out whether or not they are the Secret Supporter of Tyndale.</p>

                                <li>There will always be at least 4 Bishop's Agents (pawns) searching for Tyndale.</li>
                                <li>If there are 5 or 6 players, the players searching for Tyndale each blindly draw a card from the Bishop's Agent cards.</li>
                                <li>There is one "Secret Supporter" card - if a player draws this card, that player will secretly try to help Tyndale. This player can withhold information from others.</li>
                                <li>Each player secretly shows their card to the Tyndale player so that he knows who (if anyone) is on his side.</li>
                                <li>If there are fewer than 5 players, there will be 4 pawns and one or more players will control more than one pawn.</li>
                                <li>If there are 5 players, there will be 4 pawns, one per non-Tyndale player.</li>
                                <li>If there are 6 players, there will be 5 pawns.</li>
                                <li>Players choose their pawns and place them on any location on the board (no more than one pawn per location).</li>
                                <li>After the Bishop's Agents have placed their pawns (and shown their cards to Tyndale if appropriate), he chooses any location as his starting point. If he chooses a Printing Centre, he publishes the New Testament in that city and writes an "N" in the corresponding circle on his Scoresheet.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>Players take turns, starting with Tyndale, and going in clockwise order. If a player is controlling more than one pawn, that player moves each pawn in turn before play advances to the next player.</p>
                              <h4>Tyndale's Turn</h4>
                              <p>If you are Tyndale, on your turn:</p>
                              <ol>
                                <li>Decide your next move. You can move horizontally or vertically to an adjacent spot on the map. If that spot is blue, you can move a second time to an adjacent spot. You can pass through, but not finish on a spot occupied by a Bishop's Agent.</li>
                                <li>Write the letter representing the most recent <strong>publication</strong> (N, P, H, or O) in the circle on your Scorecard associated with each of your moves. If you've previously visited this location with a different <strong>publication</strong>, replace the previous letter with the most recent <strong>publication</strong> letter.</li>
                                <li>If the spot where you finish is a Coastal City and you have a <strong>publication</strong> that has not yet shipped, then send that <strong>shipment</strong> on its journey. Find the small number near the city on the Scorecard indicating the number of moves it will take for the <strong>shipment</strong> to reach London and circle that number next to the appropriate letter in the table at the top of your Scorecard. If it will take more than 10 moves, instead of a number you will find a "+" and will circle "11+". Once you have <strong>shipped</strong> a <strong>publication</strong>, you immediately complete the next <strong>translation</strong>. Your next goal is to take this new <strong>translation</strong> to a Printing Centre you have not previously visited to get it <strong>published</strong>.</li>
                                <li>If the spot where you finish is a Printing Centre that you have not previously visited and you have a <strong>translation</strong> that has not yet been <strong>published</strong>, then you get it <strong>published</strong> in this city. Your next goal is to take this publication to a Coastal City to <strong>ship</strong> it to London.</li>
                                <li>If you have any <strong>shipments</strong> that have not yet arrived in London, cross off the next number (starting with 1) in the row for that <strong>publication</strong>. When you cross off the circled number, announce to all players which <strong>shipment</strong> has now arrived in London. If the <strong>Old Testament</strong> arrives in London, the game is over and Tyndale (and the Secret Supporter) has won.</li>
                              </ol>

                                <li>Tyndale starts in Antwerp (E5) where he <strong>publishes</strong> and <strong>ships</strong> the New Testament. He writes an "N" in the circle at E5 and circles the number "3" in the "N" row in the table in the top left of the scorecard.</li>
                                <li>On his first turn he moves to Cologne (F5) where he <strong>publishes</strong> the Pentateuch. He writes a "P" in the circle at F5 and crosses off the "1" in the "N" row of the table.</li>
                                <li>On his second turn he moves to F4 where he <strong>ships</strong> the Pentateuch. He writes a "P" in the circle at F4, circles the "5" in the "P" row of the table, and crosses off the "2" in the "N" row.</li>
                                <li>His third turn he moves to H4. He writes a "P" in the circles at G4 and H4, crosses off the "3" in the "N" row and the "1" in the "P" row of the table and announces that the New Testament has <strong>arrived</strong> in London.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>During this third round, two of the Bishop's Agents receive clues from Tyndale.</p>
                              <p>One moves to E6 and receives:</p>

                              <p>Another moves to G4 and receives:</p>

                              <h4>Bishop's Agent's Turn</h4>
                              <p>For all other players, on your turn:</p>
                              <ol>
                                <li>Roll the die to determine how many spaces to move.</li>
                                <li>Move your pawn the number of spaces indicated by the die. You may pass through, but not finish on a space populated by another Bishop's Agent.</li>
                                <li>You may ask Tyndale if there's anything in the final location where you land. He will hand you two cards. Tyndale cannot lie.
                                  <ol>
                                    <li>One card indicates whether or not he is in that location. For Bishop's Agents, this will simply say whether or not he is there, but for the Secret Supporter, the card might say that he is "near" or "far". If you are not the Secret Supporter and you have landed on Tyndale's location, announce that you have captured "that notorious heretic Tyndale." The Bishop's Agents have won the game.</li>
                                    <li>The second card indicates whether or not there are any <strong>publications</strong> in that city, or if there are "rumors of a translation" - meaning an adjacent (horizontal or vertical) space has a <strong>publication</strong>. You can mark what you learned in the corresponding circle on your Scorecard. You can also share this information with other players. If there is nothing in that city, the appropriate response is "Nothing to Report".</li>
                                  </ol>
                                </li>
                              </ol>
                              <p>Note that Tyndale only leaves copies of his <strong>publications</strong> (clues) where he personally travels. (When he travels by boat on water spaces, he leaves <strong>publications</strong> with fishermen he encounters at each water location.) But once he <strong>ships</strong> a <strong>publication</strong>, there will NOT be any clues along the route that the <strong>publication</strong> is traveling on its way to London.</p>

                                <li>You start in Prague (K6).</li>
                                <li>On your first turn, you roll a "3" and move to Nuremburg (I7).</li>
                                <li>You ask Tyndale what's there. He gives you the two cards shown below. You place an "X" in the I7 circle.</li>
                              </ul>

                                <li>On your second turn, you roll a "2" and move to Strasburg (G7).</li>
                                <li>You again ask Tyndale and he gives you the same two cards. you place an "X" in G7.</li>
                                <li>On your third turn, you roll a "3" and move to E6.</li>
                                <li>You again ask Tyndale and this time he gives you the two cards shown below. You place an "R" in E6.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <img style="float: right; max-width: 50%" alt="Nothing Here" src="../assets/TyndaleRumorsCard.png" />
                              <img style="max-width: 50%" alt="I Am NOT Here" src="../assets/TyndaleNotHereCard.png" />
                              <p>Each turn, your fellow Bishop's Agents are also sharing the information that they have received and you also mark that information on your scorecard.</p>

                              <h4>Special considerations for the Secret Supporter</h4>
                              <p>If you are the Secret Supporter, you may have the opportunity to help Tyndale escape persecution and get the English Bible to the English people. There are two ways that you can help, if you feel so led.</p>
                              <p>The first way is by carrying a <strong>published</strong> translation to the coast for <strong>shipping</strong>. If Tyndale tells you that there is a <strong>publication</strong> in a city that you visit that hasn't yet <strong>arrived</strong> in London, by next visiting a Coastal City, you will be carrying that <strong>publication</strong> with you. If Tyndale hasn't yet <strong>shipped</strong> that <strong>publication</strong> (only he knows), he will track your movements and appropriately record the <strong>shipment</strong> when you reach the Coastal City.</p>
                              <p>The second way you can help is by NOT helping the Bishop's Agents. Lying and deceit are an abomination to God and a violation of the ninth commandment. However, the fifth commandment ("thou shalt not murder") includes the positive requirement of preserving human life. Sharing everything you know with the Bishop's Agents may lead to Tyndale's capture and unjust execution.</p>
                              <p>While Bishop's Agents are allowed to share information with each other, they aren't required to. If the cards shown by Tyndale indicate that there are no translations at a location and he is not there, the appropriate response to other players is "Nothing to Report". Tyndale's Secret Supporter may also choose not to report it if she finds rumors, translations, or Tyndale himself. A simple "Nothing to Report" will both protect Tyndale and avoid sinning.</p>

                              <h4>Exposing the Secret Supporter</h4>
                              <p>While playing the game, Bishop's Agents may begin to suspect that one of their own is actually a Secret Supporter of Tyndale's efforts.</p>
                              <p>Any Bishop's Agent may accuse another of being a Secret Supporter, but only immediately following the announcement of the <strong>arrival</strong> of a <strong>publication</strong> in London. All Bishop's Agents players will vote on whether or not to formally charge the accused. A majority vote results in charges.</p>
                              <p>If charged, the accused player must show their Bishop's Agent card to reveal whether or not they are the Secret Supporter.</p>
                              <p>If they are the Secret Supporter, then they are out of the game. Their pawn is removed from the board and they can no longer take turns. If they were carrying a <strong>publication</strong> for Tyndale, that is lost and Tyndale must find another way to get the <strong>publication</strong> to a Coastal City for <strong>shipment</strong>.</p>
                              <p>If they are not the Secret Supporter, then the one making the false accusation is out of the game. Their pawn is removed fro the board and they can no longer take turns.</p>
