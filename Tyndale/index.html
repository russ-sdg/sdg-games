                              <p><em>Tyndale</em> is a hidden movement game. One player is on the run, trying to complete translation, printing, and shipping of the Bible while the other players try to track him down based on clues Tyndale leaves behind.</p>
                              <p>William Tyndale has fled England to Europe with the mission of translating the Bible from the original Hebrew and Greek into English. The Bishop of London is determined to stop him. Tyndale will need to move around Europe to avoid capture. As he completes translation of portions of scripture, he must visit a new Printing Centre to get each one printed, and then get the printed copies to a Coastal City for shipment to England.</p>
                              <p>At the beginning of the game, Tyndale has completed translation of the New Testament. He needs to get it to a Printing Centre to get it published and then to a Coastal City, so that he can ship it and begin working on translating the Pentatuch. At each city that he visits, he will “leave behind” copies of his most recently published translation (if any). These will be clues for those chasing or helping him. Once a published translation reaches a Coastal City, it independently (in the hands of trusted merchants) begins the journey across the English Channel or North Sea and then the English countryside towards London.</p>
                              <p>The game may be played by two to six players and typically takes 30 to 90 minutes to play.</p>

                                <li>The gameboard represents a map of England and Europe.</li>
                                <li>The map is overlaid with a grid.</li>
                                <li>The vertical grid lines are labeled A-K and the horizontal gird lines are labeled 1-11.</li>
                                <li>On land, the intersections of the grid lines are cities and towns. On water, the intersecting locations are also legal moves (by boat), but aren't labeled.</li>
                                <li>Printing Centres are cities marked by a large circle and labeled with the city name.</li>
                                <li>Coastal Cities are cities or towns that are one step away from a water location.</li>
                                <li>Cities and towns loyal to the Pope are colored Red.</li>
                                <li>Cities and towns sympathetic to the Reformation are colored Blue.</li>

                                <li>There will be 4 or 5 pawns moving from location to location on the Gameboard.</li>
                                <li>These pawns represent the Bishop’s Agents who are searching for Tyndale. (Although one might be a Secret Supporter who is actually helping him.)</li>
                                <li>Pawns move vertically and horizontally along the grid lines on the Gameboard.</li>

                              <p>The game uses a 6 sided die with values 1, 2, and 3.</p>
                              <h4>Scorecard</h4>

                                <li>Each player gets a Scorecard.</li>
                                <li>Each Scorecard shows a simplified representation of the Gameboard.</li>
                                <li>Tyndale uses his Scorecard to record where he has left copies of his Publications.</li>
                                <li>Bishop’s Agents use their Scorecards to record clues they find as they search for Tyndale.</li>
                                <li>The small numbers next to Coastal Cities indicate their distance from London.</li>
                              </ul>

                              <ul>
                                <li>William Tyndale is captured (the Bishop's Agents win), or</li>
                                <li>The Old Testament reaches London (Tyndale and his Secret Supporter win).</li>
                              </ul>
                              <h4>Game Setup</h4>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Each Player takes a Scorecard.</li>
                                <li>One player will be William Tyndale. He does not have a pawn because his moves are secret.</li>
                                <li>There will always be at least 4 Bishop's Agents (pawns) searching for Tyndale.</li>
                                <li>If there are 5 or 6 players, the players searching for Tyndale each blindly draw a card from the Bishop's Agent cards.</li>
                                <li>There is one "Secret Supporter" card - if a player draws this card, that player will secretly try to help Tyndale. This player can withhold information from others.</li>
                                <li>Each player secretly shows their card to the Tyndale player so that he knows who (if anyone) is on his side.</li>
                                <li>If there are fewer than 5 players, there will be 4 pawns and one or more players will control more than one pawn.</li>
                                <li>If there are 5 players, there will be 4 pawns, one per non-Tyndale player.</li>
                                <li>If there are 6 players, there will be 5 pawns.</li>
                                <li>Players choose their pawns and place them on any location on the board (no more than one pawn per location).</li>
                                <li>After the Bishop's Agents have placed their pawns (and shown their cards to Tyndale if appropriate), he chooses any location as his starting point. If he chooses a Printing Centre, he publishes the New Testament in that city and writes an "N" in the corresponding circle on his Scoresheet.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>Players take turns, starting with Tyndale, and going in clockwise order. If a player is controlling more than one pawn, that player moves each pawn in turn before play advances to the next player.</p>
                              <h4>Tyndale's Turn</h4>
                              <p>If you are Tyndale, on your turn:</p>
                              <ol>
                                <li>Decide your next move. You can move horizontally or vertically to an adjacent spot on the map. If that spot is blue, you can move a second time to an adjacent spot. You can pass through, but not finish on a spot occupied by a Bishop's Agent.</li>
                                <li>Write the letter representing the most recent <strong>publication</strong> (N, P, H, or O) in the circle on your Scorecard associated with each of your oves. If you've previously visited this location with a different <strong>publication</strong>, replace the previous letter with the most recent <strong>publication</strong> letter.</li>
                                <li>If the spot where you finish is a Coastal City and you have a <strong>publication</strong> that has not yet shipped, then send that <strong>shipment</strong> on its journey. Find the small number near the city on the Scorecard indicating the number of moves it will take for the <strong>shipment</strong> to reach London and circle that number next to the appropriate letter in the table at the top of your Scorecard. If it will take more than 10 moves, instead of a number you will find a "+" and will circle "11+". Once you have <strong>shipped</strong> a <strong>publication</strong>, you immediately complete the next <strong>translation</strong>. Your next goal is to take this new <strong>translation</strong> to a Printing Centre you have not previously visited to get it <strong>published</strong>.</li>
                                <li>If the spot where you finish is a Printing Centre that you have not previously visited and you have a <strong>translation</strong> that has not yet been <strong>published</strong>, then you get it <strong>published</strong> in this city. Your next goal is to take this publication to a Coastal City to <strong>ship</strong> it to London.</li>
                                <li>If you have any <strong>shipments</strong> that have not yet arrived in London, cross off the next number (starting with 1) in the row for that <strong>publication</strong>. When you cross off the circled number, announce to all players which <strong>shipment</strong> has now arrived in London. If the <strong>Old Testament</strong> arrives in London, the game is over and Tyndale (and the Secret Supporter) has won.</li>
                              </ol>
