                              <p>Each Fruit Basket card has three fruit of the Spirit and their associated icons. Each player gets a Fruit Basket card and this determines which Fruit cards he is trying to collect.</p>
                              <p>Here are a few examples:</p>

                              <p>Each player is given an Instruction card, which shows in words and symbols, the actions they take, in order, on their turn.</p>

                              <h4>Team Play</h4>
                              <p>If you have 4 to six players, you can play <em>The Fruit of the Spirit</em> as teams of two or three players.</p>
                              <h5>Objective</h5>
                              <p>Be the first team to display all 9 Fruit of the Spirit cards.</p>

                              <h5>Game Setup</h5>
                              <ol>
                                <li>Form teams of 2 or 3 players each.</li>
                                <li>Remove the 2 game instruction cards from the deck.</li>
                                <li>Shuffle the remaining Fruit and Deed cards.</li>
                                <li>Deal 5 cards to each player.</li>
                                <li>Place remaining cards face down as a draw pile.</li>
                                <li>Turn the top card over to form a discard pile.</li>
                              </ol>
                              <p>It might be helpful to download (<a href="../assets/Fruit Tree v1.pdf">from here</a>) and print the Fruit Tree as a visual reminder of the Fruit Cards to be collected. Each team can put a Fruit Tree printout in front of one of their players and then play Fruit cards onto the matching spaces. When all nine spaces on the Fruit Tree in front of a player are filled with the corresponding Fruit cards, then that team has won the game.</p>

                              <h5>Game Play</h5>
                              <p>Players take turns drawing, discarding, and playing Fruit and Deed cards on their Fruit Tree in front of them.</p>
                              <p>On each turn, a player may:</p>
                              <p>Skip their turn (other players on their team do NOT need to skip their turns), OR</p>
                              <ol>
                                <li>Draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile.</li>
                                <li>If possible, follow instructions on one Fruit Card and one Deed Card.</li>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Playing a Joy or a Faithfulness card does not count as your one Fruit Card for your turn.</li>
                                  <li>When played, a Fruit Card is displayed face up on the team's Fruit Tree.</li>
                                  <li>A Deed Card is played on top of the Self-Control card if it is showing, otherwise, it is played on top of any other Fruit Card.</li>
                                  <li>Any Fruit Card covered by a Deed Card must be "re-earned" or "redeemed".</li>
                                  <li>"Re-earning" a Fruit Card means that a player on that team must get another of that Fruit in their hand again and follow the instructions again to be able to play it on top of the covering Deed Card.</li>
                                  <li>"Redeeming" a Fruit Card happens when either the Self-Control Card is played by a player on this team, or the Love Card is played by an opposing player and used to remove all Deed Cards on this team's Fruit Tree.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Discard as many cards as the player desires.</li>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Deed cards can only be discarded if the Self-Control Card is showing on the team's Fruit Tree.</li>
                                </ul>
                              </ol>
                              <p>At the end of each turn, the player draws (from either pile) or discards cards as necessary to end the turn with 5 cards in his hand.</p>
